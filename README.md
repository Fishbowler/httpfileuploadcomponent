About
-----
This application allows occupants of an [XMPP](https://xmpp.org) multi-user chat room to share data (images and such) with each-other.

More specifically, this is a [Jabber Component](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html) that implements [XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html)

Download
--------

The compiled application, as well as the source code, is available for download on the ['releases' page](https://github.com/guusdk/httpfileuploadcomponent/releases) of this project.

Building
--------

This project is using a Maven-based build process. To build this project yourself, ensure that the following are available on your local host:

* A Java Development Kit, version 8.
* Apache Maven 3

To build this project, invoke on a command shell:

    $ mvn clean package

Upon completion, the application will be available in the `target` directory.

Usage
-----
To run the application, execute

    java -jar httpfileuploadcomponent-<versionnumber>-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    
A number of arguments can (and probably should) be added. A common execution is:

    java -jar httpfileuploadcomponent-<versionnumber>-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
       --xmppHost openfire1.example.org \
       --sharedSecret hqcUrfHtgE73FktcXwfrP

This will start the application, connect it to an XMPP server with the provided
shared secret, and launch a webserver on a non-local interface of the machine on
which the application is executed.

When end-users should interact with the webserver using a different address, the
``announcedWebHost`` argument can be used. This provides a convenient way to work
with remote proxies or port-forwarded network topologies.

A full set of usage instructions are provided by adding the ``--help`` argument:
 
    $ java -jar httpfileuploadcomponent-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar --help
    usage: arguments
       --announcedWebHost <arg>   The hostname or IP address that is to be
                                  used by the end users (when different from
                                  webHost). Defaults to the webHost address.
       --announcedWebPort <arg>   The TCP port number that is to be used by
                                  the end users (when different from
                                  webPort). Defaults to the webPort value.
    -h,--help                     Displays this help text.
       --sharedSecret <arg>       The shared secret, that authenticates this
                                  component with the XMPP domain.
       --webHost <arg>            The hostname or IP address on which the
                                  webserver will be ran. Defaults to an
                                  arbitrary, non-local address of this
                                  machine.
       --webPort <arg>            The TCP port number of the webserver.
                                  Defaults to 12121.
       --xmppHost <arg>           The FQDN or IP address (not XMPP domain
                                  name) of the XMPP domain that this
                                  component will connect to. Defaults to
                                  'localhost'.
       --xmppPort <arg>           The TCP port number on the xmppHost, to
                                  which a connection will be made. Defaults
                                  to 5275.
